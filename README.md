## Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction  

In this task, I built a *regression model* to predict *IMDB movie ratings* based on the dataset provided.  

### Steps Involved:
- Imported and explored the dataset.  
- Performed data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection).  
- Built and trained a machine learning regression model.  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and error metrics.  

### Results:
- Model Accuracy: *0.83*  

### Files:
- Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction.ipynb (Google Colab Notebook)  
- Screenshots of the code and results

## Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification 🌸  

In this task, I built a *classification model* to predict the species of Iris flowers using the famous *Iris dataset*.  

### 🔹 Steps Involved:
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.  
- Performed data visualization using pairplots to understand feature distribution.  
- Preprocessed the data and split it into training and testing sets.  
- Trained a *Logistic Regression model* for classification.  
- Evaluated the model using *Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix*.  

### 🔹 Results:
- Model Accuracy: *100% (1.0)* 🎯  
- The dataset is linearly separable, hence Logistic Regression achieved perfect classification.  

### 🔹 Files:
- Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification.ipynb (Google Colab Notebook)  
- Screenshots of dataset exploration, visualizations, accuracy report, and confusion matrix.

📊 Task 4 – Sales Prediction Using Python

📌 Project Overview

Sales prediction is the process of forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, considering various factors such as advertising expenditure across TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
This project applies Machine Learning (Linear Regression) in Python to analyze and interpret the relationship between advertising spends and sales.

By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies, reduce costs, and maximize sales potential.


---

📂 Dataset

We use the Advertising dataset, which contains:

TV Advertising Spend (in $)

Radio Advertising Spend (in $)

Newspaper Advertising Spend (in $)

Sales (in $)
---

⚙ Steps Performed

1. Data Loading & Exploration – Inspect dataset, check missing values, summary stats.


2. Data Visualization – Scatter plots & correlation heatmap.


3. Model Building – Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.


4. Evaluation – Mean Squared Error (MSE) & R² score for accuracy.


5. Visualization – Actual vs Predicted sales graph.


6. Prediction – Predict sales for new advertising spend inputs.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

scikit-learn

---

📊 Results

The model provides a strong correlation between advertising spends and sales.

Achieved a high R² score, showing the model explains most of the variance in sales.

Example Prediction:

Input → TV=230.1, Radio=37.8, Newspaper=69.2

Output → Predicted Sales ≈ 21.5
