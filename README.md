## Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction  

In this task, I built a *regression model* to predict *IMDB movie ratings* based on the dataset provided.  

### Steps Involved:
- Imported and explored the dataset.  
- Performed data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection).  
- Built and trained a machine learning regression model.  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and error metrics.  

### Results:
- Model Accuracy: *0.83*  

### Files:
- Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction.ipynb (Google Colab Notebook)  
- Screenshots of the code and results
