## Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction  

In this task, I built a *regression model* to predict *IMDB movie ratings* based on the dataset provided.  

### Steps Involved:
- Imported and explored the dataset.  
- Performed data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection).  
- Built and trained a machine learning regression model.  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and error metrics.  

### Results:
- Model Accuracy: *0.83*  

### Files:
- Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction.ipynb (Google Colab Notebook)  
- Screenshots of the code and results

## Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸  

In this task, I built a *classification model* to predict the species of Iris flowers using the famous *Iris dataset*.  

### ðŸ”¹ Steps Involved:
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.  
- Performed data visualization using pairplots to understand feature distribution.  
- Preprocessed the data and split it into training and testing sets.  
- Trained a *Logistic Regression model* for classification.  
- Evaluated the model using *Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix*.  

### ðŸ”¹ Results:
- Model Accuracy: *100% (1.0)* ðŸŽ¯  
- The dataset is linearly separable, hence Logistic Regression achieved perfect classification.  

### ðŸ”¹ Files:
- Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification.ipynb (Google Colab Notebook)  
- Screenshots of dataset exploration, visualizations, accuracy report, and confusion matrix
